GENERAL 
c--, a top-down shooter, comprises a player repelling swarms of 
encroaching enemies; weapons, grenades, and health-pickups 
periodically appear, in order to aid the player in combating 
progressively stronger opponents. c--, however, relies on a 
unique mechanic to diversify gameplay: the speed of light 
linearly decreases. Thus, as the player survives for lengthier 
periods of time, the effects of special relativity gradually 
become more profoud: geometry distorts, colors striate, and 
movements are visually misrepresented. 

PLAYER INTERACTION
The player will command a figure combating waves of various 
enemies with a diverse arsenal of weaponry. 
				    The goal?
					Survive.

SPECIFIC

The speed of light was intended to linearly decrease as the 
game progresses: the substantive effects of relativity would
transitively become increasingly more apparent. Geometry would 
distort, and movements would be visually misrepresented. The 
player will collect fivetypes of weapons- a sniper rifle, 
machine gun, shotgun, pistol,and grenades- whilst combating 
four types of enemies- grunts, charges, juggernauts, and splitters. 
To the developers' regret, special relativity proved significantly 
too unwieldy to implement- c--'s primary proof of principle, MIT 
Game Lab's 'A Slower Speed ofLight,' relied on simulational mechanics: 
objects were either stationaryor moved in perfectly straight line 
(towards infinity), thereby simplifying the tedious mathematics that 
required execution, and circumvented a 'realistic' application of the 
required physics. Initial attempts succeeded in implementing relativity's 
visual effects, but succumbed to compounding
computational inaccuracies.
