GENERAL IDEA
Top-down swarm shooter incorporating the laws of special relativity.


REPLICATING AN EXISTING GAME?
Uhhh. Well, A Slower Speed of Light (from MIT Game Labs) was
inspiration for the relativity part. Geometry wars is currently the
desired theme for graphics.


INCORPORATION OF APCS TOPICS
It's written in Java.


PROOF OF PRINCIPLE
The game with all laws incorporated except for those involving photons
and graphics / final polish. It might also not have all weapons and
enemy classes completed.


MAJOR COMPONENTS
Laws of special relativity.
Visual distortion and color shift.
Actors and bullet violence.


DIVISION OF LABOR / TASK DELEGATION
Sebastian will be implementing the update() method for Actors, as it
involves a thorough knowledge of special relativity.
Otherwise, as needed.
