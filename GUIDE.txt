GENERAL 
c--, a top-down shooter, comprises a player repelling swarms of 
encroaching enemies; weapons, grenades, and health-pickups 
periodically appear, in order to aid the player in combating 
progressively stronger opponents. c--, however, relies on a 
unique mechanic to diversify gameplay: the speed of light 
linearly decreases. Thus, as the player survives for lengthier 
periods of time, the effects of special relativity gradually 
become more profoud: geometry distorts, colors striate, and 
movements are visually misrepresented. 

PLAYER INTERACTION
The player will command a figure combating waves of various 
enemies with a diverse arsenal of weaponry.
